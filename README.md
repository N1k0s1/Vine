# Vine 
This website is for a new potential YSWS, called Vine.   
In essence, you make a piece of music using an open source, code based music development software of your choice. Muse/Sonic Pi recommended 
Once you've finished, you submit your work, and get a 5' Vinyl with your music on it! (60 seconds to 4 minutes) 

A link to the current website can be found here
